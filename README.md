# QuantEcon-Classification

## Background/Instructions

The midterm is to complete a slightly modified version of the exercises in the QuantEcon datascience classification lecture (which can be found here [here](https://datascience.quantecon.org/applications/classification.html))

There are a total of 8 questions that need to be completed and plenty of learning/reading material along the way.

Please make sure to attempt/complete all 8 exercises to the best of your ability. Note that some questions have multiple parts. Read the question carefully and respond to each part.

Next to each exercise will be a point total for that question. There are a total of 150 points possible in this exam.

Once you have completed all questions, please upload your completed notebook to Brightspace. **Do not** change the name of the notebook. It should remain `classification.ipynb`

You are permitted to use any existing online resource as you work on the exam. Google is your friend. You are not permitted to post a question to a forum, message group, or any other form of online or in person communication to get help on the exam.

You are to work alone.

There is no autograding for this assignemnt. All responses will be graded by one of the professors.

If you have quesitons, you can email one of the professors or post a question on Brightspace (if your question is potentially helpful to other students, we may ask that an emailed question be reposted on Brightspace). We will only answer *clarifying* questions if something is unclear.
